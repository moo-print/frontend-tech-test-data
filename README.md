### Bootstrapping

We encourage you to use tooling to bootstrap the app so that you can start the task at hand as quickly as possible. Here is an example using React, TypeScript, and Storybook, but feel free to use any tools of your choosing.

- `npx create-react-app product-configurator --template typescript`
- `cd product-configurator`
- `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init`
