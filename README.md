# MOO Frontend Technical Task

### Files

* Product Options component input data - `./productOptionsData.json`
* Theme - `./theme.js`

### Bootstraping 

Feel free to use what ever technology you want, but we encourage you to use tooling to bootstrap the app so that you can get started with the task at hand as quickly as possible.  Here is an example with React, Typescript and Storybook.

- `npx create-react-app product-options --template typescript` 
- `cd product-options`
- `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init`
